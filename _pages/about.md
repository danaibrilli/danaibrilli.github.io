Hello everyone!
My name is Danai Brilli and I graduated from a joint Bs/Ms in Computer Science from the Electrical & Computer Engineering School at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). I am currently pursuing a second MSc on Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine at NTUA, while also working as a researcher on Medical Imaging at the University of Pennsylvania, working on brain cancer. 

The motivation behind my research has always been to improve human health & quality of life through AI. My research interests lie in leveraging AI to advance our understanding of disease progression, develop personalized treatments and identify new therapeutic targets. I look forward to delving deeper in these areas during my PhD. 

Feel free to reach out to me at my [email](mailto:danaibrilli@gmail.com) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danai-brilli) :).
